	# Backups - by default anyone who knows where your copy of
	# parallel-flickr is (on the Internet) could register to have
	# their photos (and likes) backed up. If you don't want to

	# 1) enable the feature flags below for invite codes and
	#    god auth (which is explained later)

	# 2) generate a new secret for encrypting invite cookies
	#    parallel-flickr/bin/generate_secret.php
